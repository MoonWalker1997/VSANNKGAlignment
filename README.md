# VSANNKGAlignment

The repository of paper "Aligning Knowledge Graphs Provided by Humans and Generated by Neural Networks" by Tangrui Li $^1$ (tuo90515@temple.edu) and Jun Zhou $^2$ (tun40202@temple.edu).

# Requirements

Pytorch, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib. Necessary basic packages.

# Usage

To run Experiment 1.
```$ python Experiment1.py```
To make it act fast, I set the number of epoch to `10`. If you want to have more epochs, please change it in the file (at `line 13`). The training batch size is set to `128` by default, which can be also changed in `Data.py` (though not recommended).

For Experimen 2. There are 8 options in a file.
```$ python Experiment2.py```
To change the setting, you need to edit the file from `line 17` to `line 24` by only uncommenting 1 row of them. Everything is trained on `CPU` by default (since I am working on Apple M2 chip). If you are not satisfied with the speed, please consider changing two parameters: **1)** the training batch size (`128` by default, in `Data.py`), though this not recommended; **2)** the number of times each experiment is repeated (`5` by default, you can change it in the file at `line 34`).

For Experimen 3. There are 19 options in a file.
```$ python Experiment3.py```
To change the setting, you need to edit the file from `line 15` to `line 33` by only uncommenting 1 row of them. If you are not satisifed with the performance (when your device is good), you can make the value at `line 135` larger. This value can be larger than 1, but this value means the proportion of the number of items in $KG_{NN}$ compared to $KG_G$. If the value is 0.2, that means $KG_{NN}$ only contains 20% of the number of items in $KG_G$. Therefore, please don't make it too large since this method includes $O(n^2)$ components.

# Sample outputs

The followings are the sample experiment (mentioned in the paper) results.

## Experiment 1

I set the training batch size as `128` and ran 10 epochs. The left image is the first 50-D in $VSA_{NN}$ before training, and the right image is the first 50-D in $VSA_{NN}$ after training.

The left image is the average $KGV_{NN}$ (with values $\geq$ 0.5) for all numbers, and the right image is the corresponding results from the decoder.

The following image is the matching found beween NN-generated concepts and the human-provided one.

## Experiment 2

The following is the 8 sub-experiments in experiment 2. In which \# $E$ represents the number of entities in $KG_G$, \# $T$ represents the number of triples in $KG_G$, $p$ represents the proportion of items in $KG_{NN}$ to $KG_G$, $C$ represents the alignment consistency

</p>

## Experiment 3

The following is the 19 sub-experiments in experiment 3. In which $O$ represents the index of ontology used Text2KGBench, $CT$ represents the matching consistency, $S$ represents the average similarities of vectors in $VSA_{NN}$, $BLoss$ represents the bipolar loss of vectors in $VSA_{NN}$, \# $E$ represents the number of entities in the ontology, \# $R$ represents the number of relations in the ontology.
