# VSANNKGAlignment
The repository of paper "Aligning Knowledge Graphs Provided by Humans and Generated from Neural Networks in Specific Tasks".

# Requirement
Pytorch, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib. Just basic packages.

# Usage
To run Experiment 1.
```$ python main.py```
To make it reacts fast, I set the epoch to 1. If you want to do more epochs, please change it in the file.

To run Experimen 2. There are 5 separated files.
```
$ python test_0.py
$ python test_1.py
$ python test_2.py
$ python test_3.py
$ python test_4.py
```
Each corresponds to one aspect mentioned in the paper. It might take some time.
